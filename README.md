# Linguistics 168: Computational Speech Processing

# HMM Word Classifier

This project incorporates Hidden Markov Models at classifying fruits based on a sounds pronounciation

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install everything required for this project.

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
## NOTE

There may be compatibility issue with the versions ```numpy``` in order for it to work with ```librosa``` imports:
A manual reinstallation of both packages to get the current versions for this code will work:

``` pip install numpy==1.26.4 ```
``` pip install librosa==0.10.2 ```

Never a bad idea to start a venv just in case

## Usage
